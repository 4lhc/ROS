# MiBand HRX ROS Controller

A simple controller based on the 3-Axis accelerometer readings from a Xiaomi MiBand-HRX.
Python bluepy library is used to communicate with the device. The code for which can be found [here](https://github.com/4lhc/MiBand_HRX). More information about BLE communication, parsing and processing raw accelerometer data can be found on that repo. I have also included a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/4lhc/MiBand_HRX/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb) there.

## Setup
